# Beaglebone-Black FTDI

## Notes : 
 Future Technology Devices International (FTDI) allows us to view all of the serial debug output of the BBB . Through the FTDI header we can supervise the boot process of the BBB (both bootloader and kernel output as the system is initialized), and also accessing a console shell into Linux or Android (the installed operating system on BBB).
