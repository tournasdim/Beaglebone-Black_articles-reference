## Guidelines

* All hyperlinks are grouped by subject, each subject is written into a separate document and is labeled accordingly. For instance : Bluetooth, Wifi, Books etc. Subjects might be grouped into one document (not more than three) if their functionality overlap (ie PWM - Servo). Later on, if the size of a "grouped - document" becomes difficult to be managed (ie more than hundred links), each subject will be separated into its own document.
* Add one link per Pull Request.
* Add a new subject-document (if it's not yet defined in the list): `* [category-name](http://example.com/) - A short description ends with a period.`
* Keep descriptions concise.
* Add a section if needed.
    * Add the section description.
    * Add the section title to Table of Contents.
* Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Don't mention `Beaglebone Black or BBB` in the description as it's implied.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Remove any trailing whitespace.
* Send a Pull Request with a note why the hyperlink is worth to be listed .
